      "We price a Maravilla home by analyzing comparable sales, current active competition, buyer demand, and your home's condition and upgrades. The goal is to generate strong buyer interest and protect your net proceeds, not simply \"pick a number.\"",
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I fix before listing in Maravilla?',

  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need staging to sell my Maravilla home?',
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: 'Is an online estimate accurate for Maravilla?',
    answer:
      'Online estimates can be a rough starting point, but Maravilla values often hinge on specific features (layout, condition, finishes, lot position). A local valuation adds context that automated estimates often miss.',

  },
  {
    question: 'How often do Maravilla valuations change?',
